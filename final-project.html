  <h1>Final Project Proposal: Gragon Ball Power Sensor</h1>
  <p>
  Final project is based on Dragon Ball cartoon and the goal is to create a game where a user can play as the character in dragon ball by muscle sensor/ ki chi mechanism to create different actions. We were first inspired by the Dragon Ball VR game which can be seen through the video:

    <p>
    Right now, we are only on our first step. My teammate Han and I are working together on the project.
    I am in charge of creating background, characters and diffeernt actions and Han is trying to figure out the use of muscle sensor and translate it into codes to our program.
    Here are some scratches we have done:

    <img src="images/demo1.jpg" height="400" width="600" />
    <img src="images/demo2.jpg" height="400" width="600" />
    <p>
      There are differnet kinds of moves that a muscle sensor can test (about 4-5).
      Ideally we want to generate different actions of character with those moves.
      For example, if the player holds a fist, the chracter, Goku, turns to super sayan mode( yellow hair as shown on the picture).
      We also want it to have some effects such as bubbles flowing around the Goku when he is turning into super sayan.
      Another example will be when the player waves to the left, Goku can punch or kick or any other different actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently the demo reads in fist gestures and counts how many seconds does the user holds the same gesture. The bubble particles
      start moving using Perlin noise as long as the user staying in fist gesture. On release particles will disappear. On the 5 second
      mark the Goku character will turn into super sayan 1 mode. On the 10 second mark the character will turn into super sayan 2 mode.

  <h2>Some challenges/concerns:</h2>
  <ul id="challenges">
    <li>
      There are not many 3D resources online for Goku. Since p5 does not support animation, it is a little bit hard to come up with several actions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using myo sensor is a brand new idea for us. There are some techincal issues and limited sources.
    </li>
    <li>
      Even though the creating process is faily hard, I am afraid the idea of the game is not complex enough and the player experience is lower than expectation.
