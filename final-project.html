    <h2> Game Mechanism </h2>
    By contracting muscle and reading in the contraction with Myo muscle sensor
    the VR world will generate yellow orbs/particles based on the level of contraction.<br>
    We will add more particle or environmental elements into the world as we progress.<br>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    - Setting up the myo sensor requires many softwares and configurations. In the middle of the process
    I found out that a bluetooth signal receiver is missing from the set and need to talk to professor.
